# About Me

Zijian Zhou, a Ph.D. student at Shanghai University specializing in Computer Science and Technology. I am deeply passionate about the fields of artificial intelligence and unmanned systems. My current research is centered on creating robust sim-to-real transfer methods, enabling unmanned systems to make effective behavioral decisions in complex, real-world scenarios.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Jiangxi Agricultural University, which laid the groundwork for my advanced studies. I then pursued and completed my Master's degree at Shanghai University, where I am now continuing with my doctoral research, consistently focusing on the challenges and opportunities within computer science.

I have gained substantial hands-on experience through my involvement in high-level research projects. I contributed to a key project sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, where my work focused on applying reinforcement learning to the sim-to-real transfer of autonomous behaviors for unmanned vehicles. My responsibilities included designing and validating decision-making algorithms in virtual environments and ensuring their efficacy through realistic simulations. Additionally, I participated in the Artificial Intelligence Innovation Contest, developing a novel autonomous decision-making framework that synergizes Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the performance of unmanned vehicles.

My dedication to my studies and research has been recognized with several notable honors. I have won the Third Prize in both the "Huawei Cup" National Postgraduate Mathematical Modeling Competition and the Artificial Intelligence Innovation Contest. During my academic career, I have been awarded the National Endeavor Scholarship twice, named an "Excellent Student" at Shanghai University, and received a First-Class Academic Scholarship. I am also a certified Intermediate Software Designer.
